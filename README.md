Steps to Use Web3Forms to Link Email with Your Website
Step 1: Sign Up for Web3Forms
Visit Web3Forms and sign up for a free account.
After signing up, you'll receive an access key that will be used to link your form submissions to your email.
Step 2: Create the HTML Form
In your website's HTML file, add a contact form. Here's an example code snippet:
html
Copy code

<form action="https://api.web3forms.com/submit" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE">
    <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" required>
    <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your Email" required>
    <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your Message" required></textarea>
    <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
Replace "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE" with your actual access key from Web3Forms.

Step 3: Configure Email Settings (Optional)
To customize how form responses are sent to your email, you can configure optional fields such as:
Redirect URL: Add <input type="hidden" name="redirect" value="https://your-website.com/thank-you"> to redirect users to a custom thank-you page.
Custom subject line: Add <input type="hidden" name="subject" value="New Contact Form Submission"> to set the email subject.

Step 4: Test the Form
Upload your HTML file to your web server or hosting platform.
Submit the form and check if the submission reaches your email.
Make sure to check both your inbox and spam folder.

Step 5: Styling and Enhancements
You can style your form using CSS to match your website design.
Optionally, integrate JavaScript to provide real-time form validation or show alerts after submission.

Step 6: Go Live
Once you've tested the form and everything works smoothly, deploy your website or update the form on your live site.
That's it! You've successfully integrated Web3Forms into your website to handle email submissions efficiently and securely.
